# Installer Nagios Core sur Kali Linux


## Prerequisites

```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y autoconf gcc libc6 make wget unzip apache2 apache2-utils php libgd-dev
```

## Downloading the Source

```
cd /tmp
wget -O nagioscore.tar.gz https://github.com/NagiosEnterprises/nagioscore/archive/nagios-4.4.3.tar.gz
tar xzf nagioscore.tar.gz
```

## Compile

```
cd /tmp/nagioscore-nagios-4.4.3/
./configure --with-httpd-conf=/etc/apache2/sites-enabled
make all
```

## Create User And Group

This creates the nagios user and group. The www-data user is also added to the nagios group.

```
make install-groups-users
usermod -a -G nagios www-data
```

## Install Binaries

This step installs the binary files, CGIs, and HTML files.

```
make install
```

## Install Service / Daemon

This installs the service or daemon files and also configures them to start on boot.

```
make install-daemoninit
```

## Install Command Mode

This installs and configures the external command file.

```
make install-commandmode
```

## Install Configuration Files

This installs the *SAMPLE* configuration files. These are required as Nagios needs some configuration files to allow it to start.

```
make install-config
```

## Install Apache Config Files

This installs the Apache web server configuration files and configures the Apache settings.

```
make install-webconf
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod cgi
```

## Configure Firewall

You need to allow port 80 inbound traffic on the local firewall so you can reach the Nagios Core web interface.

```
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j ACCEPT
apt-get install -y iptables-persistent
```

Answer yes to saving existing rules

## Create nagiosadmin User Account

You'll need to create an Apache user account to be able to log into Nagios.

The following command will create a user account called nagiosadmin and you will be prompted to provide a password for the account.

```
htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
```

When adding additional users in the future, you need to remove -c from the above command otherwise it will replace the existing nagiosadmin user (and any other users you may have added).


## Start Apache Web Server


Need to restart it because it is already running.

```
systemctl restart apache2.service
```

## Start Service / Daemon

```
systemctl start nagios.service
```

## Test Nagios

Nagios is now running, to confirm this you need to log into the Nagios Web Interface.

Point your web browser to the ip address or FQDN of your Nagios Core server, for example:

http://10.25.5.143/nagios

http://core-013.domain.local/nagios

You will be prompted for a username and password. The username is nagiosadmin (you created it in a previous step) and the password is what you provided earlier.

Once you have logged in you are presented with the Nagios interface. Congratulations you have installed Nagios Core.
BUT WAIT ...

Currently you have only installed the Nagios Core engine. You'll notice some errors under the hosts and services along the lines of:

(No output on stdout) stderr: execvp(/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_load, ...) failed. errno is 2: No such file or directory 

These errors will be resolved once you install the Nagios Plugins, which is covered in the next step.


# Installing The Nagios Plugins

Nagios Core needs plugins to operate properly. The following steps will walk you through installing Nagios Plugins.

These steps install nagios-plugins 2.2.1. Newer versions will become available in the future and you can use those in the following installation steps. Please see the releases page on GitHub for all available versions.

Please note that the following steps install most of the plugins that come in the Nagios Plugins package. However there are some plugins that require other libraries which are not included in those instructions. Please refer to the following KB article for detailed installation instructions:
